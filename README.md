## 1. Project Overview

**What the Project Does:**  
The project is an Inventory Management System built in Java. It handles customer orders, tracks product stock, and predicts when a product will need restocking.

---

## Main Java Classes:
- **OrderManager.java:** Manages and processes orders.
- **Product.java:** Holds information about each product (name, price, stock level).
- **Order.java:** Represents a customer's order.
- **StockPredictor.java:** Predicts when a product will run out of stock.

## 2. GitHub Conflict Resolution

I created new branches and conflicts happened when multiple branches modified the same part of the code.

- **Resolving the Conflict:**  
  When I tried to merge the branches, Git identified the conflict. I manually resolved it by reviewing the changes in both branches and carefully merging them, ensuring no necessary changes were lost.

## 3. Key Learnings

**What I Learned:**

- **Collaboration Workflow:**  
  GitHub’s pull requests and review process help maintain code quality and improve collaboration.

- **Merge Conflicts:**  
  Merge conflicts occur when two branches modify the same part of a file. To resolve them, I had to carefully review and select the necessary changes.

- **Java Programming:**
  - Object-Oriented Principles  
  - Classes and Objects  
  - Methods and Constructors

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in using GitHub for version control, especially for resolving merge conflicts. It also highlighted the importance of a good branching strategy and the role of GitHub’s collaboration tools in ensuring smooth project development. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Java programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and exception handling, which are essential for building robust software applications.
